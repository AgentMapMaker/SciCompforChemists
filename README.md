# Scientific Computing for Chemists

The following is a text used for a Scientific Computing chemistry course (*J. Chem. Educ.* **2017,** 94, 592-597 [DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00078](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00078) and *J. Chem. Educ.* **2017,** 94, 1904-1910 [DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00395](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00395)) intended to steach undergraduate chemistry students basic coding in Python and advanced tools for processing, visualization, and analysis of digital data. This course assumed that the students have no prior programming experinece and have at least one year of undergraduate chemistry background and some basic spectroscopy/spectrometry (i.e., NMR, IR, and GC/MS) background.
